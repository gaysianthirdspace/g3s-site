One of the main missions at G3S is to create a supportive gaysian community and foster mentorship and friendship as we explore our identities. To fulfill this mission, we started by creating a __Tumblr blog__ to share and archive content relevant to our community. To facilitate closer interactions, we created a __LINE chat group__ for chatting and more casual conversation. In addition to these platforms, we have created a __mentorship program__ for people to interact and learn from each other in an even smaller group setting. We are continuing to develop our initiatives—including our __Follower Friday__ and __Writer's Roundtable__ series, [__local meetups__](/meetups), and our __Mental Health Project__—to better meet the needs of our community.

If you have any questions, or if you’re interested in getting involved in any of our initiatives, please [send us a message](/contact)!

## <a name="blog"></a> Tumblr Blog

Our [Tumblr blog](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com) curates stories, posts, articles, and discussions so that we can learn from each other's experiences and thoughts. We are always seeking new contributors and content, so please [submit](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/submit) any posts, new or old, that you think could fit this mission.

We also regularly invite members of our community to guest curate our blog, where they showcase content matching a theme of their choice for a week. If you're interested in helping out with running the blog, please [send us a message](/contact).

Finally, we are [cataloging](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tags) our archives to make it easier to find content that speaks to specific topics and experiences.

## <a name="linechat"></a> LINE Chat Group

We have a chat group on LINE to facilitate closer interactions through chatting, serious discussions, and more casual conversations across many time zones. LINE Group Moderators (Fish and Jeff from the [G3S Team](/about#team)) work actively to moderate membership and monitor the chat to maintain a supportive and welcoming environment for all of the participants. They reserve the right to decline new membership or remove current members.

To join the LINE group, please follow these instructions:

1. Fill out the form here (this step is required).
2. [Download and install](https://line.me/en/download) the LINE app.
3. Send a friend request to “alostfish” on LINE.
4. Send “alostfish” a quick message on LINE so he knows to add you.
5. Please follow our LINE Group [community guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPTXCXAYPnEbOu428BZbERMQEdl5_RKLLNzAM3RuwK4/edit?usp=sharing).

We look forward to welcoming you to the group!

## <a name="mentorship"></a> Mentorship Program

We understand that people who are just beginning to explore their identities can get overwhelmed with large, fast paced group chats. Sometimes it is challenging to summon the courage to message unfamiliar people. The __G3S Mentors Program__ addresses this need. Our goal is to expand our directory of volunteer mentors (like RAs for new freshman in a college dorm) who would be willing to engage and interact with existing or new G3S members in a one-on-one or small group setting.

If you would like to sign up as a __mentor__, click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2FvWZ0IQhHNVpH4L05bPFnX3Bl8C-1fW7pntc52HxIieY0g/viewform?c=0&w=1).

If you would like to sign up as a __mentee__, click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyfccqu3Ngg18KvDpURP_LCmTArBQgBlslHLyjo6SXTXICqg/viewform?c=0&w=1).

## <a name="followers"></a> Follower Friday

We run a [Follower Fridays series](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/followerfriday) to showcase the diversity of gaysians and to get to know each other better by featuring the profile of a member of our community every Friday on our [blog](#blog) and our [Instagram account](#instagram).

## <a name="writersroundtable"></a> Writer's Roundtable

We run a [Writer’s Roundtable series](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/askG3S/chrono) to facilitate and publish conversations on topics of interest to the community. If you have any topics you’d like the writers in our community to discuss, please [submit](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/writers-roundtable) them to the Writer’s Roundtable!

## <a name="mentalhealth"></a> Mental Health Project

We are working to create resources to support mental health for queer API people, in order to help meet the needs of members of the G3S community and queer API communities more broadly. We are currently investigating how we might best leverage our collective knowledge and resources to meet the needs of our communities. If you are interested in collaborating, sharing notes, or chatting with us about queer API mental health, we'd love to talk to you! Just [send us a message](/contact) and we will follow up with you.
